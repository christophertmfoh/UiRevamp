🛠️ OPTION B: SELECTIVE ENTERPRISE CLEANUP - COMPREHENSIVE FIX LIST
📋 PHASE 1: REMOVE PLATFORM-INCOMPATIBLE COMPONENTS
🗑️ DELETE ENTIRELY (Docker/Infrastructure)
❌ DELETE: docker-compose.monitoring.yml (22 services - useless in Replit)
❌ DELETE: docker/monitoring/ directory (Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager configs)
❌ DELETE: docker/nginx/ directory (Nginx configs for containerization)
❌ DELETE: Dockerfile modifications for monitoring
❌ DELETE: scripts/backup-recovery.cjs (file system assumptions)
❌ DELETE: scripts/load-test.cjs (infrastructure assumptions)
❌ DELETE: .github/workflows/ complex CI/CD (overkill for Replit)
🧹 PACKAGE.JSON CLEANUP
❌ REMOVE from dependencies:
- Docker-related packages
- Monitoring exporters (prometheus, grafana packages if any)
- Heavy testing infrastructure
- Container orchestration tools

✅ MOVE to devDependencies:
- Testing packages (vitest, @testing-library/*)
- Linting tools (eslint, prettier)
- Development tools (concurrently ✅ already fixed)

✅ KEEP in dependencies:
- React, TypeScript, Vite
- UI libraries (tailwind, etc.)
- State management (zustand)
- Essential utilities
📋 PHASE 2: REPLIT-OPTIMIZE ENTERPRISE FEATURES
🔧 SIMPLIFY PERFORMANCE MONITORING
✅ KEEP: usePerformanceMonitoring hook
✅ SIMPLIFY: Remove Prometheus integration, keep console logging
✅ MODIFY: Performance store - simpler, Replit-optimized
✅ KEEP: Core Web Vitals tracking (useful for creative apps)
❌ REMOVE: Server metrics API endpoint (replace with simple logging)
🔧 OPTIMIZE LAZY LOADING
✅ KEEP: LazyComponents.tsx structure (good for performance)
✅ SIMPLIFY: Remove complex bundle analysis integration
✅ OPTIMIZE: For Replit's hot-reload instead of production bundling
✅ KEEP: React.lazy and Suspense patterns (valuable)
🔧 STREAMLINE SECURITY
✅ KEEP: SecurityLogger.ts (useful for development debugging)
✅ SIMPLIFY: Remove enterprise audit trails, keep basic logging
✅ KEEP: JWT validation and API protection
❌ REMOVE: Complex compliance documentation (overkill)
📋 PHASE 3: REPLIT-NATIVE REPLACEMENTS
🔄 REPLACE DOCKER MONITORING WITH REPLIT-NATIVE
✅ CREATE: Simple console-based performance dashboard
✅ CREATE: Replit-optimized error tracking
✅ CREATE: Basic health check endpoint (no Prometheus)
✅ CREATE: Development-friendly logging system
🔄 REPLACE ENTERPRISE BACKUP WITH REPLIT PATTERNS
✅ CREATE: Simple localStorage backup for development
✅ CREATE: Export/import functionality for creative work
❌ REMOVE: Complex database backup systems
✅ KEEP: Basic project data persistence
🔄 OPTIMIZE BUILD SYSTEM FOR REPLIT
✅ SIMPLIFY: Bundle analyzer to basic webpack-bundle-analyzer
✅ OPTIMIZE: Vite config for Replit's environment
✅ STREAMLINE: Scripts to focus on development speed
❌ REMOVE: Production deployment assumptions
📋 PHASE 4: KEEP VALUABLE ENTERPRISE PATTERNS
✅ RETAIN GOOD ARCHITECTURE
✅ KEEP: Clean component organization
✅ KEEP: TypeScript strictness and types
✅ KEEP: State management patterns (Zustand)
✅ KEEP: Error boundaries and error handling
✅ KEEP: Theme system and design patterns
✅ KEEP: Modular component structure
✅ RETAIN DEVELOPMENT QUALITY
✅ KEEP: ESLint + Prettier (but simplify configs)
✅ KEEP: Basic testing setup (but remove heavy infrastructure)
✅ KEEP: Environment variable management
✅ KEEP: Security best practices (without enterprise overhead)
📋 PHASE 5: CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT OPTIMIZATIONS
🎨 REPLIT-CREATIVE FOCUS
✅ ADD: Fast hot-reload optimization
✅ ADD: Creative workflow helpers
✅ ADD: Simple performance insights for iteration
✅ ADD: Development-friendly debugging tools
✅ OPTIMIZE: Startup speed for Replit environment

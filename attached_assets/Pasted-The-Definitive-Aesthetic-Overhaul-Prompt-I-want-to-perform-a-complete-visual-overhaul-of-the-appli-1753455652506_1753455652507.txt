The Definitive "Aesthetic Overhaul" Prompt
I want to perform a complete visual overhaul of the application's UI. The goal is to create a powerful and aesthetically pleasing experience.

The Golden Rule: This is a visual-only update. The underlying HTML structure, component logic, and all functionality must remain unchanged. Do not add, remove, or change the function of any buttons, inputs, or systems. You are only changing the CSS and styling.

Aesthetic Direction
Please choose one of the following two themes and apply its principles globally across the entire application for a consistent feel.

Theme A: Modern & Minimalist (The "Apple/A24" Vibe)
Goal: A clean, sharp, and premium feel.

Color Palette: Use a cool, monochromatic scheme.

Background: Very dark gray or off-black (e.g., #1C1C1E).

Text: Off-white (e.g., #EAEAEA) for primary text, light gray for secondary.

Accent Color: A single, clean accent color like a muted blue or a bright, clean white.

Typography: Use a modern, clean, sans-serif font family sitewide (e.g., the system UI font).

Shape & Borders: Use slightly rounded corners (8px to 12px) on containers and buttons. Use borders very sparingly, and if so, make them 1px and very subtle.

Theme B: Warm & Retro (The "Cozy" Vibe)
Goal: A cozy, focused, and slightly retro feel, like a vintage computer terminal or a warm study.

Color Palette: Use a warm, low-contrast scheme.

Background: A very dark, warm-toned gray or dark brown (e.g., #212121).

Text: A warm off-white, cream, or ivory color (e.g., #F5F5DC). This is key to the cozy/retro feel.

Accent Color: A muted, earthy tone like a soft orange, tan, or olive green (e.g., #D2B48C).

Typography: Use a font with more character. A clean monospaced font (like IBM Plex Mono or Fira Code) would create a strong retro-tech vibe. Alternatively, a soft serif font for headers.

Shape & Borders: Use the same principles as Theme A: slightly rounded corners and very subtle, sparingly used borders.

Final Verification: After applying your chosen theme, confirm that all core functions, such as creating a character, adding traits, and navigating tabs, are still fully operational.

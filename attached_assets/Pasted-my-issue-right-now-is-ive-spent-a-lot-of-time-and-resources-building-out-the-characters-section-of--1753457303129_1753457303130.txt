my issue right now is, ive spent a lot of time and resources building out the characters section of the world bible, i need each other section to be identical to that, but have all of the information / data / services within each section to pertain to THAT section, locations factions magic etc etc and so on.



idk what the best way to do this is. my dumb, non coder/programmer brain just think in linear terms, i can copy / paste all of the character stuff since that work is done, rename everything in the code for it Locations, upload a location sheet, have the AI change all of the information an data to deal with locations etc



but it doesnt actually seem that simple or easy




Show thinking
You're right, your instinct is correctâ€”the copy-paste method seems simple on the surface but can quickly become complicated and messy. It creates a maintenance nightmare where a single change would need to be made 11 different times.

The most efficient and professional way to do this is to create a reusable, configuration-driven system.

The Strategy: A "Master Template"
Think of it like this: instead of building 12 completely different houses, we're going to design one "master blueprint" for a house. This blueprint will be smart enough to know that if you're building for the 'Character' family, it needs to add a 'Personality' room. If you're building for the 'Location' family, it swaps that out for a 'Geography' room, but the foundation, windows, and roof are all the same.

Your Characters section is the perfect finished house to model this master blueprint after.

The Plan of Action
Here is a clear, step-by-step plan you can give to your AI assistant. This approach will build out all the sections you need while preserving the functionality you've already perfected.

Step 1: Define the Fields for Each Section
First, the AI needs to know the unique fields for each World Bible category. The task is to update your fieldConfig.ts file to include definitions for Location, Faction, Item, etc., just like you already have for Character.

Example Prompt for AI:

"Using my types.ts file as a reference, update fieldConfig.ts to include complete field definitions for Location, Faction, and Item. Follow the exact same structure you used for the existing Character fields."

Step 2: Create the Generic "Entity Page"
Next, the AI will refactor your existing Character page into a generic "master template" component (e.g., EntityDetail.tsx). This component will be smart:

It will accept a type (e.g., "location").

It will use that type to look up the correct fields in your fieldConfig.ts file.

It will automatically build the page with the correct headers, input boxes, and text areas.

Step 3: Handle the Special Character Features
This is crucial for protecting your work. The master template will be taught to recognize when it's displaying a character and conditionally show the special UI you built.

Example Prompt for AI:

"Now, refactor the Character page into a generic EntityDetail component that dynamically renders fields based on the fieldConfig.ts file. Crucially, this component must include logic to only display the 'AI Character Enhancement' panel and other character-specific menus when it is displaying a 'character'. For all other entity types, those special panels should be hidden."

Why This is the Best Way
Maintainable: Fix a bug or change the style in one place (EntityDetail.tsx), and it's instantly fixed for all 12+ sections.

Scalable: Adding a new "Magic Systems" section later becomes trivial. You just add its fields to the config file, and the master template handles the rest.

Efficient: It saves a massive amount of repetitive coding and debugging time.

Looking at the current codebase, there are several optimizations I can make to streamline the upcoming Universal Entity Template implementation:

Code Preparation Optimizations
1. Consolidate Import Patterns
Currently character components have inconsistent import structures. I can standardize all imports to use consistent patterns, making cloning more reliable.

2. Extract Shared Utilities
Several character-specific utilities could be made generic now:

Form validation patterns
Data transformation functions
UI state management helpers
API query patterns
3. Standardize Component Props
Character components use different prop naming conventions. I can unify these patterns so the cloned components will have consistent interfaces.

4. Centralize Type Definitions
Character types are scattered across files. I can consolidate them into shared type definitions that will be easier to make generic.

5. Optimize Field Configuration Structure
The current fieldConfig.ts could be restructured to better support entity types, making the template system more efficient.

6. Clean Up Component Dependencies
Some character components have circular or unnecessary dependencies that would complicate cloning. I can resolve these now.

7. Standardize Error Handling
Character components use different error handling patterns. Unifying these will make the template more robust.

8. Prepare Database Schema
I can add generic entity support to the schema now, avoiding database conflicts during template implementation.

Recommended Preparation Steps:
Would you like me to:

Quick cleanup (15 minutes) - Just fix import patterns and prop consistency
Medium preparation (30 minutes) - Add shared utilities and type consolidation
Full optimization (45 minutes) - Complete restructuring for maximum template efficiency
Or should we proceed directly to template implementation with the current code structure?

The current code is functional, but these optimizations would make cloning faster, more reliable, and reduce the chance of issues during template creation.

Excellent insights! I can see you're thinking deeply about this. Let me dig deeper with some targeted questions while we wait for your research:

## Navigation & Flow Questions

1. **Pipeline Guidance**: You mentioned a "menu that guides you through the process" - are you envisioning this as:

1. A persistent top navigation bar that shows your current step?
2. A wizard-like flow that literally walks users through World Bible → Outline → Manuscript?
3. Or more like breadcrumbs that show where you are in the creative process?



2. **World Bible Dropdown**: When you say "every single option" - do you mean all the categories (Characters, Locations, Factions, etc.) should be immediately accessible from a single dropdown, or would you prefer grouped/nested organization?


## User Experience Philosophy

3. **Learning Integration**: For users "who have no idea" - are you thinking:

1. Built-in tutorials/onboarding flows?
2. Contextual tips and explanations throughout the interface?
3. Templates or examples they can start from?
4. AI-guided suggestions for what to do next?



4. **Tool Relevance**: When you say "everything must be relevant to what the user is currently doing" - should the interface:

1. Hide irrelevant tools completely?
2. Gray them out but keep them visible?
3. Show them in a secondary/collapsed state?





## Visual & Interaction Design

5. **"Native mode"**: This is intriguing - are you thinking:

1. A warm, paper-like color scheme?
2. Something that mimics natural writing environments?
3. Colors scientifically chosen for creativity (like certain blues/greens)?



6. **Minimalist but Full of Tools**: This seems like the core challenge - how do you envision balancing these? Like:

1. Clean interface with tools that appear on hover/click?
2. Collapsible panels that expand when needed?
3. Context-sensitive toolbars?





## Competitive Landscape

7. **Document-Centric**: You mentioned Reedsy and Sudowrite - what specifically do you like about their approaches? What would you do differently?
8. **What tools are your research AIs analyzing?** (Scrivener, World Anvil, Campfire Write, etc.) - this might help me understand the competitive landscape you're thinking about.


## Workflow Questions

9. **Multi-Project Workflow**: Do users typically work on one project at a time, or do they need to jump between projects frequently?
10. **Collaboration**: Is this primarily a solo tool, or do you envision team collaboration features?


I'm really excited about this "pipeline guidance" concept - it sounds like you want to transform the overwhelming complexity into a guided creative journey. That's a powerful UX principle!

This is an absolutely brilliant research report! Your AI has done exceptional work analyzing the competitive landscape and identifying the core challenges. Let me share my thoughts on the key insights:

What Strikes Me Most
The "Sequestered Complexity" Principle - This is the golden insight. The idea that power should be "on-demand" rather than "ever-present" perfectly captures what's wrong with most creative tools. Scrivener overwhelms, Reedsy limits, but the solution isn't compromise - it's architectural.

The Studio & Workbench Model - This is genuinely innovative. I love how it mirrors real creative workflows - you have your overview space (studio) and your focused work areas (workbenches). This could be your major differentiator.

The Pipeline Philosophy - Your vision of World Bible → Outline → Manuscript → Storyboard → Previs → Score as a guided creative journey is powerful. It teaches storytelling while providing tools.

Questions This Raises
The "Cozy Creative" Theme: The research mentions warm, candlelit aesthetics. How do you envision balancing this with the professional, tool-heavy interface? Should this be one of several theme options, or the primary aesthetic direction?
AI Integration Depth: The report emphasizes Sudowrite's "suggestion card" pattern. Given your vision for cross-medium conversion (novel → screenplay → comic), how aggressive should the AI be? Should it proactively suggest conversions, or wait for user initiation?
Onboarding Complexity: The research suggests a guided wizard, but you mentioned wanting to serve both novices and professionals. How do we avoid making pros feel patronized while still teaching storytelling fundamentals?
The Collaboration Question: The report emphasizes real-time collaboration, but you mentioned this is primarily a solo tool. Should we prioritize the technical infrastructure for collaboration even if it's not the primary use case?
Strategic Implications
The research validates your instinct that the current UI needs a complete reimagining. The modular "workbench" approach could solve the overwhelming complexity problem while maintaining power.

Key Takeaway: The path forward isn't about adding more features - it's about sequencing complexity and creating contextual relevance.

What aspects of this research resonate most with your vision? And which recommendations feel like they might conflict with your gut instincts about the product direction?

i like it, i like what i said and what were settling on, my aesthetic for the native app itself, and then having the option for normal light/dark modes. (maybe more)2. the AI should only do stuff if you want it to, or if you have "Guide" mode on. 3. we can turn "hints" or "AI Guide" mode off or on4. we should focus on solo for now, with collab integration in the future. what sort of UI do you envision now?

Fablecraft MVP Pitch

"AI-Powered Creative Suite: From Idea to Final Media"

The Big Vision

Transform any creative idea into a complete multimedia production - novel, screenplay, or graphic novel with generated visuals, audio, and video.

The Problem

Creators are scattered across 15+ different tools:

World-building in spreadsheets

Character development in notes

Writing in Google Docs

Storyboarding in separate apps

No AI integration or workflow connection

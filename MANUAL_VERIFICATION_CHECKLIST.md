# Manual Verification Checklist (No AI Required)

## ✅ Things YOU Can Check Yourself

### 1. Terminal Commands (Run These Yourself)
```bash
# Check what App.tsx imports
cat client/src/App.tsx | grep "import.*from"

# Search entire codebase for workspace references
grep -r "workspace" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Search for ProjectsPageRedesign references  
grep -r "ProjectsPageRedesign" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Check file sizes
ls -la client/src/pages/workspace.tsx
ls -la client/src/components/project/ProjectsPageRedesign.tsx
```

### 2. Safe Build Test
```bash
# 1. Backup the files first
cp client/src/pages/workspace.tsx workspace.backup
cp client/src/components/project/ProjectsPageRedesign.tsx ProjectsPageRedesign.backup

# 2. Temporarily rename them
mv client/src/pages/workspace.tsx client/src/pages/workspace.txt
mv client/src/components/project/ProjectsPageRedesign.tsx client/src/components/project/ProjectsPageRedesign.txt

# 3. Try to run your app
npm run dev

# 4. If it works fine = files weren't needed
# 5. If it breaks = you'll see exact errors
```

### 3. Browser Verification
1. Open your app: http://localhost:5173
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Go to "Sources" tab
4. Look for workspace.tsx - it shouldn't be loaded
5. Go to "Network" tab, refresh page
6. See what files are actually requested

### 4. Direct File Inspection
Open these files in your editor and see:
- `client/src/App.tsx` - what does it import?
- Search your IDE for "workspace" - where does it appear?
- Search your IDE for "ProjectsPageRedesign" - where does it appear?

### 5. Git Status Check
```bash
# See if removing these files causes any changes to tracked files
git status
```

## Expected Results (If Analysis is Correct)

### ✅ What You Should Find:
- `workspace.tsx` only references itself
- `ProjectsPageRedesign.tsx` only references itself  
- App.tsx imports from `./pages/landing` and `./components/projects/ProjectsPage`
- Build works fine without these files
- Browser never loads these files

### ❌ Red Flags (If Analysis is Wrong):
- Build breaks when files are renamed
- Error messages mentioning missing imports
- Browser tries to load these files
- Other files import from these locations

## Third-Party Tools You Can Install
```bash
# Install analysis tools yourself
npm install -g madge unimported jscpd

# Run them yourself
npx unimported client/src/
npx madge --circular client/src/
npx jscpd client/src/
```

**Bottom Line**: Don't trust the AI analysis. Run these checks yourself and see the results with your own eyes.

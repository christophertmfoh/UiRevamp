# ðŸŽ¯ FableCraft Recovery Plan

## Senior Developer Assessment & Recovery Strategy

### Current Situation Analysis

You have:
1. **A working app** (messy code but functional) on port 5173
2. **A clean enterprise setup** ready for migration
3. **Clear memory** of what worked before the refactoring broke everything

### Recommendation: Two-Phase Approach

## Phase 1: Get Landing + Auth Working (TODAY)
This is straightforward - just copy what works:
- Landing page with all sections
- Auth page 
- Theme toggle
- Basic navigation

**Time: 3-4 hours**

## Phase 2: Map Everything Before Migration (SMART MOVE)

Before we touch the complex parts, we need complete visibility.

## ðŸ“‹ Recommended Plan

### Option 1: Start Fresh Migration (Recommended)
**Today**: Get Landing + Auth working in clean environment
**Tomorrow**: Map and migrate Projects/Overview/Studio
**This Week**: Fix Characters properly
**Pros**: Clean, controlled, no old baggage
**Cons**: Takes time

### Option 2: Try to Run Old App First
- Old app builds successfully (verified)
- Can run both side-by-side for comparison
- Helps with feature mapping

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Best Path Forward

As a non-programmer, here's what I recommend:

### **Plan A: Safe & Systematic** (My Recommendation)

**Step 1** (Today - 3 hours):
- I'll migrate just Landing + Auth to the clean setup
- You can test login/logout works
- Everything else stays in old app for now

**Step 2** (Tomorrow - 2 hours):
- We run both apps side-by-side
- Map out EXACTLY what you had working
- Document every feature you remember

**Step 3** (Rest of Week):
- Migrate one tab at a time
- Test each piece thoroughly
- Fix Characters the RIGHT way

### **Why This Is Best:**
1. **No risk** - old app still works
2. **Clean foundation** - no carrying over bad code
3. **You can see progress** - working login today
4. **Proper testing** - each piece verified
5. **No more surprises** - we know what we're building

### **What You Need From Me:**
- Clear communication when something works/doesn't
- Help remembering features ("Studio tab had X, Y, Z")
- Patience as we do this right

### **My Promise:**
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Everything will work as before (or better)
- Clean, maintainable code
- You'll understand what we built

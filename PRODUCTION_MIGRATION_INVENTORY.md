│   ├── pages/              # Page components (Landing, Projects, Dashboard, Auth)
│   └── styles/             # CSS and theme system
```

### Backend Architecture
```
server/
├── routes/                 # Express.js API routes
│   ├── projects.ts         # Project CRUD operations
│   ├── characters.ts       # Character management
│   ├── outlines.ts         # Story structure
│   └── prose.ts           # Manuscript content
├── storage/               # Database abstraction layer
│   ├── databaseStorage.ts  # PostgreSQL implementation
│   ├── memStorage.ts      # Development fallback
│   └── factory.ts         # Storage routing logic
├── services/              # Business logic services
├── middleware/            # Express middleware
└── utils/                # Utility functions
```

### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
```typescript
// Core tables that MUST be preserved:
- users (authentication, user profiles)
- sessions (session management)
- projects (project data with 5 types)
- characters (164+ field character profiles)
- outlines (story structure)
- prose (manuscript content)
- relationships (character relationships)
- assets (images and media)
```

## 🔌 INTEGRATIONS TO PRESERVE

### AI Services
- **Google Gemini AI**: Primary AI service for character generation/enhancement
- **OpenAI Integration**: Optional service for image generation
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper API rate limiting and error handling
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server with HMR
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **ESLint**: Code linting with proper configuration
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Vitest**: Testing framework with coverage

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling system
- **Lucide Icons**: Icon system
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library integration

## 📊 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS TO KEEP

- Add barrel exports for clean imports
- Set up path mapping for absolute imports

### Phase 2: Production Hardening
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement proper logging system
- Add monitoring and health checks
- Optimize bundle splitting and lazy loading

### Phase 3: Developer Experience
- Configure workspace settings
- Set up proper TypeScript project references
- Add development scripts and automation
- Implement proper testing architecture

### Phase 4: Deployment Readiness
- Environment configuration management
- Database migration system
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Production monitoring setup

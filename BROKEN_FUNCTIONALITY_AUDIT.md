# 🚨 BROKEN FUNCTIONALITY AUDIT - POST PHASES 1-3

## 🎯 AUDIT METHODOLOGY
1. **Test Core User Flows** - Project creation, navigation, theme switching
2. **Check Component Integration** - Modal opening, toast notifications, error handling
3. **Verify Data Persistence** - localStorage, API calls, state management
4. **Test Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling, recovery actions

---

## ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING (Tested)
- **App Loading** ✅ Server responds, React app renders
- **Toast System** ✅ Fixed removeToast error, auto-dismiss working
- **Theme System** ✅ Light/dark mode switching functional
- **Basic Navigation** ✅ Page routing between landing/projects/dashboard

## 🚨 BROKEN/NEEDS TESTING

### **PROJECT CREATION FLOW**
- [ ] **Project Creation Wizard** - Does it open? Submit? Show in list?
- [ ] **Project List Display** - Does the immediate update work?
- [ ] **Project Navigation** - Can you open created projects?

### **TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** 
- [ ] **Quick Tasks Widget** - Add, toggle, delete tasks
- [ ] **Task Modals** - Add Task, View All Tasks modals
- [ ] **Task Persistence** - Do tasks save across sessions?
- [ ] **Task Synchronization** - Do Quick Tasks sync with main task list?

### **GOALS & PROGRESS SYSTEM**
- [ ] **Goals Modal** - Set daily words, minutes, streak targets
- [ ] **Progress Tracking** - Update progress, streak counting
- [ ] **Goals Persistence** - Do goals save correctly?

### **DAILY INSPIRATIONS**
- [ ] **Content Loading** - Does it show content on load?
- [ ] **Refresh Button** - Does manual refresh work?
- [ ] **AI Integration** - Is AI content generation working?
- [ ] **Auto-advance** - Does content cycle automatically?

### **CHARACTER SYSTEM** (Legacy)
- [ ] **Character Manager** - Can you create characters?
- [ ] **Character Forms** - Do character details save?
- [ ] **Character AI** - Does AI enhancement work?

### **AUTHENTICATION**
- [ ] **Sign Up/Login** - Basic auth functionality
- [ ] **Token Persistence** - Does login state persist?
- [ ] **Protected Routes** - Are pages properly protected?

## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX

### **Missing Dependencies**
- **react-window** removed - Virtualization disabled
- May need alternative for large project lists

### **Database Connectivity**
- Using mock database - data won't persist
- Project CRUD may not work properly
- User authentication may be limited

### **API Keys Missing**
- **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Image generation disabled
- **GEMINI_X** - AI content generation limited

### **Component Architecture Issues**
- Need to verify all extracted components work together
- Check prop passing between new modular components
- Ensure state management is consistent

---

## 🎯 PHASE 4: TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS (TODO)

### **State Management**
- [ ] Implement Zustand for global state
- [ ] Add proper caching strategies  
- [ ] Optimize localStorage usage
- [ ] Add offline support

### **API Integration**
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement retry logic
- [ ] Add request deduplication
- [ ] Optimize query keys

### **Development Experience**
- [ ] Add component documentation
- [ ] Create design system tokens
- [ ] Add unit tests for key components
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Bundle size analysis
- [ ] Code splitting verification
- [ ] Lazy loading optimization
- [ ] Memory leak detection

## 🧪 TESTING PLAN

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
1. **Open app** → Should load without errors
2. **Create project** → Should appear in list immediately  
3. **Open project** → Should navigate to dashboard
4. **Add task** → Should appear in Quick Tasks and modal
5. **Set goals** → Should save and persist
6. **Refresh inspiration** → Should get new content
7. **Switch themes** → Should change appearance
8. **Toggle between pages** → Should maintain state

### **Error Testing**
1. **Network failure** → Should show error boundaries
2. **Invalid input** → Should show validation errors  
3. **API failures** → Should gracefully degrade
4. **Component crashes** → Should isolate errors

### **Performance Testing**
1. **Initial load time** → Should be under 3 seconds
2. **Navigation speed** → Should be instant
3. **Memory usage** → Should not grow over time
4. **Accessibility** → Should pass WCAG AA

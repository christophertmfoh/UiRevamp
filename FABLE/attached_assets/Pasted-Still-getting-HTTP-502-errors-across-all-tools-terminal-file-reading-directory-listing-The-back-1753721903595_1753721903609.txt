Still getting HTTP 502 errors across all tools (terminal, file reading, directory listing). The backend services I'm connected to are still experiencing issues.

Unfortunately, I can't pull your changes or check the current state of your code right now.

For the Vite config fix, you'll need to add that allowedHosts: "all" line manually as I described. The exact location should be in the server block of your client/vite.config.ts file.

Once you add that line and restart npm run dev, your React app should be accessible on port 5173 without the "Blocked request" error.

Let me know when you've made the change and if it resolves the issue - I'll try the tools again periodically to see if the 502 errors clear up!

i dont know how to add the code or run the command or anything 
I understand! You're using cursor.com in the browser and need step-by-step help. Let me guide you through this simply:

Step 1: Open the file in Replit
Go to your Replit project
In the file tree on the left, find and click: client folder
Click on: vite.config.ts
Step 2: Find the right spot
Look for this section in the file:

server: {
  port: 5173,
  host: "0.0.0.0",
Step 3: Add one line
Right after the line that says host: "0.0.0.0", Add this new line:

allowedHosts: "all",
So it looks like:

server: {
  port: 5173,
  host: "0.0.0.0",
  allowedHosts: "all",
  proxy: {
Step 4: Save and restart
Save the file (Ctrl+S)
In Replit's terminal (bottom of screen), press Ctrl+C to stop the servers
Type: npm run dev and press Enter
That's it! The blocked request error should be gone and your React app should work on port 5173.

Can you find the client/vite.config.ts file in Replit?

this is what it looks like in my vite.config.ts now and allowedhosts is underlined red
 // Development server configuration with proxy
  server: {
    port: 5173,
    host: "0.0.0.0",
    allowedHosts: "all",
    
    // File system security
    fs: {
      strict: true,
      deny: ["**/.*"],
    },
    
    // Proxy API calls to Express server
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:5000',
        changeOrigin: true,
        secure: false
      }
    }
  },
  
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "dist/public"),
    emptyOutDir: true,
The red underline is a TypeScript error because allowedHosts: "all" might not be the correct type. Let's fix this:

Change this line:
allowedHosts: "all",
To this instead:
allowedHosts: [".replit.dev", "localhost"],
Or try this version:
host: true,
Your fixed section should look like:
server: {
  port: 5173,
  host: "0.0.0.0",
  allowedHosts: [".replit.dev", "localhost"],
  
  // File system security
  fs: {
    strict: true,
    deny: ["**/.*"],
  },
  
  // Proxy API calls to Express server
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:5000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false
    }
  }
},
Make that change, save the file, and restart:

Ctrl+C to stop servers
npm run dev to restart
The array format [".replit.dev", "localhost"] should fix the TypeScript error and still allow Replit's dynamic hostnames.

where do i do the ctrl+c and the run dev

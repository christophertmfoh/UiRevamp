Here's a summary based on the results (note: some results are incomplete due to API limitations, so you should verify directly on GitHub for full details):

1. Directory Structure
Unfortunately, the top-level and client/src/ directory listings could not be retrieved automatically.
Recommendation:

Please provide a manual listing (e.g., output of tree -L 2 from your repo root).
2. package.json Review
No direct match for your repo's package.json was found in the code search results (these were from other projects).
Recommendation:

Please upload or paste the contents of your actual package.json (root and/or client).
3. Vite Config (client/vite.config.ts)
The search returned examples from other repos.
A typical config for your stack should look like:


client/vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import viteTsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), viteTsconfigPaths()],
Check:

Make sure you have @vitejs/plugin-react and any aliasing plugins installed.
4. TypeScript Config (client/tsconfig.json)
Here’s a reference config from a similar project:


client/tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "module": "ESNext",
Check:

Ensure your config supports absolute imports and strict mode.
5. Example Component/Feature Module
No files were retrieved from your actual repo.
Recommendation:

Please upload or paste a representative component or feature module (e.g., from client/src/components/character/CharacterForm.tsx).
Action Required From You
To complete the validation and migration planning:

Paste your actual top-level and client/src/ directory listing.
Upload or paste your real package.json (root and/or client).
Confirm your vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json match the above best practices.
Provide a sample of a feature or component file.
Once you provide these, I’ll:

Confirm compatibility with your architectural migration plan.
Flag any legacy patterns, config issues, or migration blockers.
Recommend precise migration steps for your codebase.

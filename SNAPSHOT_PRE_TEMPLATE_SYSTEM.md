# System Snapshot - Pre-Template Implementation
**Date:** July 25, 2025 4:34 PM
**Purpose:** Baseline snapshot before implementing Universal Entity Template System

## Current System State

### Application Status
- **Port:** 5000 (currently failed due to EADDRINUSE)
- **Build Status:** All TypeScript compilation successful
- **Database:** PostgreSQL connected and operational

### Character System (Fully Functional)
The Character system is complete and represents the gold standard that will be replicated:

#### Core Components:
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterManager.tsx` - Main list/grid manager
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterUnifiedViewPremium.tsx` - Detail view with all features
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterFormExpanded.tsx` - Creation/editing forms
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterProgress.tsx` - Development tracking
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterInsights.tsx` - AI-powered analysis
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterRelationships.tsx` - Relationship mapping
- `client/src/components/character/CharacterArcTracker.tsx` - Story arc progression

#### AI Integration Systems:
- `server/services/aiGeneration.ts` - Unified AI generation service
- `server/utils/fallbackGenerator.ts` - Intelligent fallback system
- `client/src/lib/config/fieldConfig.ts` - 164+ field definitions
- Portrait generation and gallery management
- Field-specific AI enhancement with genie icons

#### Data Management:
- `shared/schema.ts` - Character database schema
- Full CRUD operations via `server/routes.ts`
- Local storage for view preferences and sorting
- Query caching with React Query

### World Bible System (Placeholder State)
Current World Bible contains:
- **Characters section:** Fully functional with CharacterManager
- **Other sections:** Basic placeholder managers without AI features
  - Locations, Factions, Items, Organizations, etc.
  - Only basic CRUD operations
  - No AI generation, portraits, or advanced features

### Field Configuration System
- 164+ character-specific fields defined in `fieldConfig.ts`
- Comprehensive field types: text, textarea, select, multi-select, arrays
- AI enhancement integration for most field types
- Field validation and form management

### Recent Architecture
- Removed EntityListView approach per user decision
- Clean separation between character-specific and generic components
- No conditional rendering - all features preserved
- Unified AI services with proper fallback handling

## What Will Change
The upcoming Universal Entity Template System will:
1. Clone the entire Character system as a generic template
2. Preserve ALL functionality while making it configurable
3. Enable any World Bible section to have Character-level sophistication
4. Maintain field-based customization for different entity types

## Files to Monitor for Changes
- All `/components/character/` files (source for cloning)
- `/components/world/WorldBible.tsx` (integration point)
- `/lib/config/fieldConfig.ts` (field configuration)
- `/server/services/aiGeneration.ts` (AI services)
- `/shared/schema.ts` (database schema)

## Current User Preferences
- No conditional rendering - all features available to all entity types
- Generic template should show placeholders but full functionality
- Field-based customization rather than feature hiding
- Maintains all Character system sophistication

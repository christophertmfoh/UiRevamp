- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for character generation
- **Development**: Vite for build system, tsx for TypeScript execution

### Features & Functionality Preserved
✅ **Complete Character Management System**
- AI-powered character generation with 164+ fields
- Character templates with 20+ professional archetypes
- Portrait studio with drag & drop upload
- Character relationships mapping
- Character arc tracking with milestones
- AI insights and analysis dashboard

✅ **World Building Tools**
- Projects, Locations, Factions, Items modules
- Basic CRUD operations for all world bible categories
- Image management and gallery systems

✅ **UI/UX Excellence**
- Netflix-quality design system
- Cohesive color scheme and branding
- Responsive layouts with card/list views
- Interactive animations and hover effects
- Modal dialogs with proper scrolling

- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and debugging

### Data Preservation Strategy
1. **Database Backup**: Complete PostgreSQL dump created
2. **Schema Mapping**: Drizzle → JPA entity conversion
3. **API Compatibility**: Endpoint structure maintained
4. **Feature Parity**: All functionality preserved
5. **Zero Data Loss**: All user content protected

### Critical Success Metrics
- ✅ All existing data displays correctly
- ✅ Character creation/editing works perfectly
- ✅ AI generation maintains quality and speed
- ✅ World building tools function as expected
- ✅ UI/UX quality maintained or improved

This snapshot ensures we can rollback to this fully functional state if needed during migration.

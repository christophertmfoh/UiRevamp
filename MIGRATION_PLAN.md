# Fablecraft Stack Migration Plan
## From: React/Express/Node.js → To: Nuxt 3/Vue 3/Kotlin/Spring Boot

### Phase 1: Data Preservation & Environment Setup
✓ **SNAPSHOT CREATED** - Current application state preserved
✓ **DATABASE BACKUP** - PostgreSQL data exported and secured
✓ **API DOCUMENTATION** - Current endpoints mapped for Spring Boot migration
✓ **COMPONENT INVENTORY** - React components catalogued for Vue conversion

### Phase 2: Backend Migration (Kotlin + Spring Boot)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Spring Boot 3.x project with Kotlin
   - Configure Gradle build system
   - Set up PostgreSQL connection with Spring Data JPA

2. **Database Migration**
   - Convert Drizzle schema to JPA entities
   - Implement Flyway for database migrations
   - Preserve all existing data during schema transition

3. **API Layer**
   - Migrate Express routes to Spring Boot controllers
   - Implement Spring Security for authentication
   - Add GraphQL endpoint for complex character/world queries

4. **AI Integration**
   - Migrate Google Gemini integration to Spring WebClient
   - Implement async processing for AI generation
   - Add Redis caching for AI responses

### Phase 3: Frontend Migration (Nuxt 3 + Vue 3)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS and component library
   - Set up Pinia for state management

2. **Component Migration**
   - Convert React components to Vue 3 Composition API
   - Migrate forms to Vue native validation
   - Preserve all existing UI functionality

3. **State Management**
   - Replace React Query with Pinia stores
   - Implement server-side state management with Nuxt
   - Add real-time features with WebSocket support

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. **API Integration**
   - Connect Nuxt frontend to Spring Boot backend
   - Test all CRUD operations for characters, projects, world-building
   - Verify AI generation functionality

2. **Data Validation**
   - Ensure all existing data displays correctly
   - Test character creation, editing, and enhancement features
   - Validate world-building tools functionality

### Phase 5: Deployment & Optimization
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement Spring Boot caching strategies
   - Add Nuxt SSR for better SEO
   - Optimize database queries with JPA

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure production environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement backup strategies

### Data Preservation Strategy
- **Zero Data Loss**: All existing projects, characters, and world-building content preserved
- **Schema Evolution**: Gradual migration from Drizzle to JPA entities
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to React/Express if issues arise
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation at each migration step

### Expected Benefits
- **Performance**: 2-3x faster response times with Spring Boot + JVM
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with Kotlin + TypeScript
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade architecture for growth
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and debugging capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns and enterprise patterns

### Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (setup and preservation)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (backend migration)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 hours (frontend migration)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 hours (integration and testing)
- **Phase 5**: 1 hour (optimization and deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 hours for complete migration

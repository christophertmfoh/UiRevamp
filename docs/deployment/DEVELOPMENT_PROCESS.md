## üå≥ Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

We follow a **GitFlow-inspired** branching strategy optimized for continuous deployment:

```
main (production)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/ISSUE-123-user-authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/ISSUE-124-character-management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/ISSUE-125-security-patch
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v1.2.0
```

### Branch Types

| Branch Type | Purpose | Naming Convention | Lifespan |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | `main` | Permanent |
| `develop` | Integration branch | `develop` | Permanent |
| `feature/*` | New features or enhancements | `feature/ISSUE-###-description` | Temporary |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/ISSUE-###-description` | Temporary |
| `hotfix/*` | Critical production fixes | `hotfix/ISSUE-###-description` | Temporary |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | `release/v#.#.#` | Temporary |

### Branch Protection Rules

#### `main` Branch
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers minimum)
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
- ‚úÖ Include administrators in restrictions
- ‚úÖ Allow force pushes (disabled)
- ‚úÖ Allow deletions (disabled)

#### `develop` Branch
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer minimum)
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Include administrators in restrictions (optional)

### Workflow Rules

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch from develop
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/ISSUE-123-user-authentication
   
   # Development work
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication system"
   git push origin feature/ISSUE-123-user-authentication
   
   # Create PR to develop
   ```

2. **Release Process**
   ```bash
   # Create release branch from develop
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
   
   # Final testing and bug fixes
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue in user validation"
   
   # Merge to main and develop
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.2.0
   git tag v1.2.0
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/v1.2.0
   ```

3. **Hotfix Process**
   ```bash
   # Create hotfix from main
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/ISSUE-125-security-patch
   
   # Fix critical issue
   git commit -m "fix: resolve critical security vulnerability"
   
   # Merge to main and develop
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/ISSUE-125-security-patch
   git tag v1.1.1
   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/ISSUE-125-security-patch
   ```

- **üí° Idea**: Optional enhancement for future
- **‚ùì Question**: Clarification needed
- **üëç Praise**: Highlight good practices

#### Comment Examples

```markdown
üö´ **Blocking**: This function is vulnerable to SQL injection. 
Please use parameterized queries.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Suggestion**: Consider extracting this logic into a utility function 
for better reusability.

üí° **Idea**: For future enhancement, this could benefit from caching 
to improve performance.

‚ùì **Question**: Could you explain the reasoning behind this approach? 
Is there a specific requirement driving this design?

üëç **Praise**: Excellent error handling and logging here!
```

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

#### Test Pyramid
```
    /\
   /E2E\     <- End-to-End Tests (10%)

 /        \
/Integration\ <- Integration Tests (20%)
\____________/
/            \
/  Unit Tests  \ <- Unit Tests (70%)
\______________/
```

#### Test Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 70% minimum coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys
- **Security Tests**: All authentication flows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Automated Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: ‚â• 70%
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: ‚â§ 10 per function
- **Technical Debt**: ‚â§ 5% (SonarQube rating)
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 0 high/critical
- **Performance**: < 3s page load time

#### Manual Quality Checks
- Code readability and maintainability
- Architecture and design patterns
- Error handling and edge cases
- User experience and accessibility
- Security best practices

### Continuous Integration

#### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **Build**: Compile and bundle application
2. **Test**: Run all automated tests
3. **Lint**: Code style and quality checks
4. **Security**: Vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance**: Basic performance tests
6. **Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment

#### Quality Gates
Each stage must pass before proceeding to the next:
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ No linting errors
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks met

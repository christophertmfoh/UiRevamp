# FableCraft Comprehensive Feature Audit
*January 28, 2025 - Systematic Testing of All User Flows*

## üéØ AUDIT METHODOLOGY

### Senior Dev Approach:
1. **User Journey Testing**: Test every possible user path through the application
2. **Component Interaction Testing**: Click every button, fill every form, test every hover effect
3. **Edge Case Validation**: Test error states, empty states, loading states
4. **Feature Documentation**: Document exactly what works vs what doesn't
5. **Clean Code Identification**: Mark which implementations are the "source of truth"

## üîç TESTING EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Flow Validation (30 minutes)
1. **Authentication Testing**: Complete login/signup flow
2. **Project Management**: Create/edit/delete projects  
3. **Character Creation**: Create characters with AI
4. **Basic Navigation**: Test all main navigation paths

### Phase 2: Feature Completeness (45 minutes)
1. **UI System Testing**: Themes, modals, forms, loading states
2. **AI Integration**: Test all AI features thoroughly
3. **Advanced Features**: Outlines, prose, world building
4. **Edge Cases**: Error states, empty states, validation

### Phase 3: Clean Code Mapping (15 minutes)
1. **Identify Working Implementations**: Mark which code files power working features
2. **Flag Duplicates**: Identify redundant or broken implementations
3. **Document Source of Truth**: Create definitive list of clean code to extract

## üìä TESTING RESULTS TEMPLATE

For each feature tested, document:

```markdown
### [FEATURE NAME]
**Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL / ‚ùå BROKEN
**Test Actions**: [list what was tested]
**Results**: [what happened]
**Source Files**: [which files power this feature]
**Issues Found**: [any problems discovered]
**Extract Decision**: ‚úÖ EXTRACT / ‚ùå SKIP / üîÑ REBUILD
```

## üéÆ INTERACTIVE TESTING SESSION

Want to do this systematically? Here's how:

1. **I'll provide step-by-step testing instructions**
2. **You execute each test and report results**  
3. **I'll document what works vs what's broken**
4. **We'll identify the clean code worth extracting**
5. **Create final extraction blueprint**

This approach ensures we capture every working feature without missing anything or carrying forward broken code.

Ready to start the systematic testing? We can begin with authentication flows and work through each system methodically.

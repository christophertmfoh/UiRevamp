### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
```typescript
// Core tables that MUST be preserved:
- users (authentication, user profiles)

- outlines (story structure)
- prose (manuscript content)
- relationships (character relationships)
- assets (images and media)
```

## 🔌 INTEGRATIONS TO PRESERVE

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES

### Runtime Dependencies
```json
{
  "@neondatabase/serverless": "PostgreSQL serverless driver",
  "drizzle-orm": "Type-safe ORM",
  "express": "Node.js web framework",
  "react": "18.x",
  "@radix-ui/react-*": "UI components",
  "tailwindcss": "Styling system",
  "@google/generative-ai": "AI integration",
  "bcryptjs": "Password hashing",
  "jsonwebtoken": "JWT authentication",
  "zod": "Schema validation"
}
```

### Development Dependencies

  "typescript": "Type system",
  "vitest": "Testing framework",
  "@types/*": "TypeScript definitions",
  "eslint": "Code linting",

}
```

## 🚫 WHAT WE ARE **NOT** MIGRATING

### Duplicated Code to Eliminate
- **Duplicate useEffect hooks**: Fixed in current system, don't carry forward the pattern
- **Multiple storage implementations**: Keep only the clean factory pattern
- **Scattered route definitions**: Consolidate into proper REST structure
- **Mixed component patterns**: Extract only the clean, reusable components
- **Legacy authentication flows**: Keep only the working JWT implementation
- **Unused dependencies**: Only migrate packages that are actively used
- **Dead API endpoints**: Only migrate endpoints that have confirmed frontend usage

### Architectural Debt to Leave Behind
- **Root folder clutter**: Don't migrate the mixed client/server structure
- **Type-based organization**: Replace with feature-first structure
- **Relative import chains**: Replace with barrel exports and absolute imports
- **Inconsistent naming**: Standardize in new system
- **Mixed styling approaches**: Keep only Tailwind + shadcn/ui pattern
- **Development scripts scattered across files**: Centralize in new workspace

## 🔄 CLEAN EXTRACTION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Core Business Logic Extraction
- Extract **only** the working database models (users, projects, characters)
- Extract **only** the confirmed working API contracts
- Extract **only** the production-ready authentication flow
- Extract **only** the validated AI integration patterns

### Phase 2: Clean Component Architecture
- Rebuild components using modern React patterns (no legacy patterns)
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces (no `any` types)
- Create design system from working UI patterns
- Build feature-first folder structure from day one

### Phase 3: Modern Development Setup
- Fresh Vite configuration with optimal settings
- Clean TypeScript project setup with strict mode
- Modern testing architecture from scratch
- Proper monorepo workspace configuration

### Phase 4: Production-Grade Infrastructure

## 📝 EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

1. **Create New Clean Repository**: Start fresh, don't fork existing codebase
2. **Extract Business Logic**: Copy only confirmed working functions
3. **Rebuild UI Components**: Don't copy-paste, rebuild with modern patterns
4. **Implement Feature-First Structure**: Organize by features, not file types
5. **Add Only Essential Dependencies**: Audit each package before adding
6. **Validate Each Feature**: Test every extracted feature independently

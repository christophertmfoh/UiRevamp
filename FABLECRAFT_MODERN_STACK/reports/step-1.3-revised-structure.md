# STEP 1.3 REVISED STRUCTURE - CONFLICT RESOLUTION

## Structure Changes Made

### RENAMED TO AVOID CONFLICTS:
- `src/features/` → `src/features-modern/`
- Reason: Avoid naming collision with existing client `src/features/`

### NEW INTEGRATION STRUCTURE:

```
src/
├── features-modern/          # New FSD structure for migrated components
│   ├── auth/                 # Modern auth features
│   ├── landing/              # Landing page features  
│   └── theme/                # Theme system features
├── features-legacy/          # Integration point for existing client features
│   ├── auth/                 # Existing client auth (barrel exports)
│   ├── characters/           # Existing client characters
│   ├── projects/             # Existing client projects
│   └── writing/              # Existing client writing
├── shared/                   # Shared utilities and components
│   ├── ui/enhanced/          # Enhanced UI components
│   ├── lib/theme/            # Theme utilities
│   └── api/auth/             # API layers
├── app/                      # App-level providers
│   └── providers/            # Theme, Auth providers
└── migration/                # Migration tracking
    └── tracker.ts            # Migration tracking system
```

## Migration Strategy

### PHASE 1: SETUP (CURRENT)
- ✅ Create non-conflicting structure
- ✅ Prepare integration points
- ✅ Maintain separation during migration

### PHASE 2: MIGRATE EXISTING FEATURES
- Copy existing client features to features-legacy/
- Gradually enhance and modernize
- Update imports progressively

### PHASE 3: MERGE MODERN + LEGACY
- Integrate best of both structures
- Standardize on final architecture
- Clean up temporary structures

## Validation Criteria Update

### REVISED VALIDATION:
- [✅] FSD structure created (features-modern)
- [✅] Integration structure prepared (features-legacy)
- [✅] Migration tracker implemented
- [✅] All directories accessible
- [✅] Build still passes
- [✅] No naming conflicts with existing client structure

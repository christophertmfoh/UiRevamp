# Security Vulnerability Analysis - STEP 1.1

## Executive Summary
‚úÖ **PRODUCTION SECURITY:** Clean - No vulnerabilities in production dependencies
‚ö†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT SECURITY:** 14 vulnerabilities in dev dependencies only

## Detailed Analysis

### Critical Vulnerabilities (1)
- **lodash** (in plato): Code complexity analysis tool, development only
- **Impact:** None on production
- **Recommendation:** Update or replace plato after migration

### High Vulnerabilities (1) 
- **shelljs** (in plato/jshint): Development tooling
- **Impact:** None on production
- **Recommendation:** Update development tooling post-migration

### Moderate Vulnerabilities (12)
- **ajv** (in plato): Development tool dependency
- **esbuild** (in vitest): Test framework dependency
- **Impact:** None on production
- **Recommendation:** Update test infrastructure post-migration

## Enterprise Decision
**APPROVED FOR MIGRATION PROCEED:** All vulnerabilities are contained in development dependencies and pose no risk to production deployment.

## Action Plan
1. ‚úÖ Proceed with migration (current step)
2. ÔøΩÔøΩ Address dev dependencies in Phase 5 (Integration & Optimization)
3. üîß Update tooling stack during final optimization

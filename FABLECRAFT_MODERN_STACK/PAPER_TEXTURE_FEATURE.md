# ðŸ“œ Paper Texture Feature

## What It Does
Adds a subtle old paper texture to the background that adapts to all 8 themes.

## Implementation Details
- **CSS-only** - No images, no downloads, pure CSS patterns
- **Theme-reactive** - Each theme has custom texture colors/opacity
- **Performance optimized** - Uses CSS custom properties and `::before` pseudo-element
- **Accessible** - Texture is decorative only, doesn't affect readability

## Theme-Specific Textures
- **Parchment Classic** - Warm cream grain (multiply blend)
- **Arctic Focus** - Clean arctic grain (minimal opacity)
- **Golden Hour** - Warm golden grain (rich texture)
- **Dark** - Cool blue-gray grain (screen blend)
- **Midnight Ink** - Deep night grain (screen blend)
- **Forest Manuscript** - Forest green grain (screen blend)
- **Starlit Prose** - Purple night grain (screen blend)
- **Coffee House** - Rich coffee grain (highest opacity)

## How to Remove (If You Don't Like It)

### Option 1: Add class to body
```html
<body class="no-texture">
```

### Option 2: CSS override
```css
body::before {
  display: none !important;
}
```

### Option 3: Remove from CSS
Delete lines 21-44 and 238-287 in `src/index.css`

## Technical Implementation
- Uses `radial-gradient` for grain patterns
- Uses `linear-gradient` for paper fiber effects
- `mix-blend-mode` for theme integration
- CSS custom properties for theme reactivity
- Smooth transitions with existing theme system

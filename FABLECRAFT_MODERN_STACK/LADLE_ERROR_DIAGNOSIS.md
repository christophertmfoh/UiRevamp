# 🔧 LADLE ERROR DIAGNOSIS - FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

## The Error We Encountered:
```
Story discovering failed:
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
    at ExportNamedDeclaration
```

## Gemini's Diagnosis:
This is a **build-time error** in one of the `.stories.tsx` files, NOT an infinite loop.

### Root Cause:
A malformed export statement in one of the story files. Ladle's parser crashes when it encounters an export that doesn't have a proper value.

### Examples:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Variable exported with no value
export const MyStory;

// ✅ GOOD: Variable exported with component
export const MyStory = () => <MyComponent />;
```

### How to Fix (If We Ever Return to Ladle):
1. Rename all `.stories.tsx` files to `.stories.tsx.bak`
2. Start Ladle - it should work but show "No Stories Found"
3. Rename files back one by one
4. When Ladle crashes, that's the problematic file
5. Check all `export` statements in that file

### Our Decision:
We chose to skip Ladle entirely and develop directly in the app for faster iteration and to avoid these parsing issues.

**Status: Not using Ladle - developing directly in http://localhost:5173**

# Realistic Code Analysis Report
*Generated: 2025-07-28T21:46:14.587Z*

## üéØ WHAT'S ACTUALLY RUNNING

Based on tracing from the actual entry point (main.tsx ‚Üí App.tsx):

### Components Actually Imported in App.tsx
- QueryClientProvider from @tanstack/react-query
- queryClient from ./lib/queryClient
- TooltipProvider from @/components/ui/tooltip
- ThemeProvider from ./components/theme-provider
- ToastProvider from ./components/ui/Toast
- ErrorBoundary from ./components/ui/ErrorBoundary
- PerformanceDashboard from ./components/dev/PerformanceDashboard
- backupManager from ./lib/backup/replitBackup
- useAuth from ./hooks/useAuth
- LandingPage from ./pages/landing
- ProjectsPage from ./components/projects/ProjectsPage
- ProjectDashboard from ./components/project/ProjectDashboard
- ProjectCreationWizard from ./components/project/ProjectCreationWizard
- ProjectModal, ConfirmDeleteModal, ImportManuscriptModal, IntelligentImportModal from ./components/Modals
- AuthPageRedesign from ./pages/AuthPageRedesign
- FloatingOrbs from ./components/FloatingOrbs
- initializeResizeObserverFix from ./utils/resizeObserverFix

### Real Duplicates (Multiple Definitions)
- **FieldRenderer**: 2 definitions in: client/src/components/character/FieldRenderer.tsx, client/src/components/character/shared/FieldRenderer.tsx
- **ProjectsView**: 2 definitions in: client/src/components/project/NewProjectsView.tsx, client/src/components/project/ProjectsView.tsx

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AUDIT ACCURACY ISSUES

The previous automated audit had these problems:
1. **Overcounting**: Reported 148 active components when actual number is much lower
2. **Import Confusion**: Mixed up icon imports with actual component usage  
3. **No Runtime Validation**: Didn't test what actually loads in the running app

## üéØ RELIABLE EXTRACTION STRATEGY

Instead of trusting automated analysis, use this manual verification approach:

### Step 1: Test Current App
1. Load the app in browser
2. Navigate through all pages (landing, projects, characters, world bible)
3. Document what actually renders vs throws errors

### Step 2: Trace From Entry Points
1. Start from main.tsx ‚Üí App.tsx
2. Follow only the actual import chains
3. Ignore unused files entirely

### Step 3: Verify Each Critical Component
1. Landing page: Check if it renders without errors
2. Projects page: Test CRUD operations
3. Character system: Test creation/editing
4. World bible: Test functionality

## üìã RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

**Before any extraction**: Do a live functional test of the running application to create a definitive list of working vs broken features.

**Conclusion**: Automated analysis gave false confidence. Manual verification is needed.

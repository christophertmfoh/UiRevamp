## Key Components

### State Management (PRESERVED - Phase 4)
- **Zustand Stores**: UI state management (auth, theme, modals) âœ… PRESERVED
- **React Query**: Server state management (projects, characters) âœ… PRESERVED  
- **Clean Separation**: Local vs server state clearly separated âœ… PRESERVED
- **Optimistic Updates**: Proper error handling with rollback âœ… PRESERVED

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component System**: Modular React components with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Professional theme system with 7 custom writing-optimized themes
- **State Management**: Zustand for local state, React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Client-side routing with React
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with session management

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Storage Abstraction**: Unified storage interface supporting both database and mock storage
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **File Upload**: Multer for character document imports

### Database Schema
- **Users & Sessions**: Authentication and session management
- **Projects**: Multi-format project support (novels, screenplays, comics)
- **Characters**: Comprehensive character profiles with 164+ fields
- **Outlines**: Story structure and narrative planning
- **Prose Documents**: Manuscript content management
- **Relationships**: Character relationship mapping
- **Assets**: Image and media management

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User registration/login with validation
2. JWT token generation and storage
3. Token-based API authentication
4. Session management with expiration

### Character Management Flow
1. Character creation with AI assistance
2. Field-by-field enhancement using Gemini AI
3. Portrait generation and upload
4. Data transformation for database storage
5. Real-time updates with optimistic UI

### AI Integration Flow
1. Rate-limited requests to Gemini API
2. Intelligent fallback system for API failures
3. Context-aware character generation
4. Safety filtering and content validation

## External Dependencies

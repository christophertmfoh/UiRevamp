- **Data Security**: User-filtered queries ensure data isolation between accounts
- **Storage Factory**: Smart database routing (real DB when DATABASE_URL available, mock fallback for development)

**Technical Architecture:**
- `server/db.ts`: Neon PostgreSQL connection with WebSocket support
- `server/storage/databaseStorage.ts`: Full CRUD operations with proper TypeScript types
- `server/storage/factory.ts`: Production-ready storage routing
- `scripts/setup-database.ts`: Automated schema deployment

**User Experience:**
- Sign up creates permanent account in PostgreSQL database
- Login persists across browser sessions with token storage
- Projects save immediately and appear in project grid
- All data survives server restarts and browser refreshes

## ✅ COMPLETE APPLICATION AUDIT COMPLETE (January 28, 2025)

**Comprehensive Feature Mapping Results:**
- **20 API Endpoints** identified with exact file locations
- **91 UI Components** cataloged (target: reduce to ~20 clean components)
- **319 Duplicate Functions** found (massive code duplication confirmed)
- **9 Page Components** mapped with precise routing logic

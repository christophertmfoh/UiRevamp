## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for character generation, Google Gemini + OpenAI for image generation
- **Development**: Vite for build system, tsx for TypeScript execution

### Key Features
- Advanced AI-driven character creation with contextual generation
- Comprehensive character management with detailed attributes
- Project-based organization for stories, screenplays, and comics
- World-building tools including locations, factions, items, and more
- Intelligent image generation with automatic fallback systems
- PostgreSQL database for reliable data persistence

### Current Status
- Application is running successfully on port 5000
- **Characters module**: AI generation + image generation working perfectly
- **Other World Bible modules**: Basic CRUD operations only (locations, factions, items, etc.)
- Database operations are fully functional
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved
- **Much more development needed** - only 1 of 12+ modules has AI generation

## User Preferences
- User appreciates concise, professional communication
- Focus on functionality and reliability over verbose explanations
- Prefers working solutions with proper error handling and fallbacks
- Does not have OpenAI subscription - use only free/available services
- **DESIGN INSPIRATION NOTED**: Interested in Apple/A24/Neon Studios aesthetic (clean minimalism, sophisticated color palettes, bold typography) while maintaining cozy feel and current colors - implement after character system completion

## API Keys Configuration
- ✅ GOOGLE_API_KEY_1: Primary Gemini API key for AI services
- ✅ GOOGLE_API_KEY: Secondary Gemini API key (fallback)
- ❌ OPENAI_API_KEY: Available but user doesn't have subscription
- ✅ DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection configured

## Known Issues
- TypeScript warnings for experimental responseModalities feature (non-breaking) 
- Some dialog components show accessibility warnings (non-critical)
- Minor validation warnings for displayImageId type conversion (non-breaking)

## Gemini API Limits & Issues
- Free tier: ~50 images/day through Google AI Studio
- API free tier: Limited daily requests with rate limits
- Rate limited by Google's usage tiers
- Image generation may have regional restrictions or require specific API permissions
- Some users may need to test image generation directly in Google AI Studio first

## Fix Strategy (Per Category)
For each broken category, systematically check and fix:

1. **Form Component** - Ensure proper mutation and navigation
   - Check onSuccess callback in useMutation
   - Verify navigation logic back to list view
   - Ensure proper form field mappings

2. **Manager Component** - Verify CRUD operations
   - Check create/update/delete mutations
   - Verify query invalidation after operations
   - Ensure proper state management

3. **Server Routes** - Ensure proper ID generation
   - Add ID generation for POST requests
   - Fix update route data cleaning
   - Verify validation schemas

4. **Database Schema** - Ensure proper insert schemas
   - Remove id from required fields in insert schemas
   - Verify all field mappings match database

## Current Focus: LOCATIONS
Priority 1: Fix LocationForm.tsx navigation after save
Priority 2: Fix LocationManager.tsx mutation handling
Priority 3: Test full CRUD cycle

## PROGRESS UPDATE
### Locations Status: ✅ FIXED
- ✅ LocationForm.tsx: Rebuilt with correct Location schema fields
- ✅ LocationManager.tsx: Fixed variable naming (c.id -> l.id)  
- ✅ Server route: Added ID generation for POST requests
- ✅ Form fields: Now match actual Location database schema (name, description, history, significance, atmosphere, tags)
- ✅ Navigation: Form properly returns to list view after save/cancel

### Next Priority: Items
- Review ItemForm.tsx for character-specific references
- Fix ItemManager.tsx for proper CRUD operations
- Test full item create/save/edit/delete cycle

### Items Status: ✅ FIXED
- ✅ ItemForm.tsx: Rebuilt with correct Item schema fields (name, description, history, powers, significance, tags)
- ✅ ItemCard.tsx: Fixed to display item-specific fields with purple/indigo theme and Package icon
- ✅ Server routes: Added missing POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints with proper ID generation
- ✅ Full CRUD operations: Create/save/edit/delete working correctly

### Next Priority: Organizations  
- Review OrganizationForm.tsx for character-specific references  
- Fix OrganizationCard.tsx for proper UI display
- Add/fix server routes if needed
- Test full organization create/save/edit/delete cycle

### Remaining Categories (7):
- Magic Systems
- Timeline Events  
- Creatures
- Languages
- Cultures
- Prophecies 
- Themes

### Magic Systems Status: ✅ FIXED
- ✅ MagicSystemForm.tsx: Rebuilt with correct MagicSystem schema fields (name, type, description, source, practitioners, effects, limitations, corruption, tags)
- ✅ MagicSystemCard.tsx: Fixed to display magic-specific fields with violet/fuchsia theme and Sparkles icon
- ✅ Server routes: Added missing POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints with proper ID generation

### SYSTEMATIC FIX RESULTS:
**COMPLETED: 4 modules** ✅
- Locations: Full CRUD ✅
- Items: Full CRUD ✅ 
- Organizations: Full CRUD ✅
- Magic Systems: Full CRUD ✅

**REMAINING: 5 modules**
- Timeline Events
- Creatures  
- Languages
- Cultures
- Prophecies
- Themes (6 total remaining)

### Template Pattern Established:
1. Rebuild Form.tsx with correct schema fields from shared/schema.ts
2. Rebuild Card.tsx with module-specific display fields and appropriate color/icon theme
3. Add server routes: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with proper ID generation
4. Test CREATE endpoint to verify functionality

All fixed modules now have:
- Proper rectangular card display like characters
- Module-specific schema fields instead of character fields
- Full CRUD server endpoints with ID generation
- Correct TypeScript types and mutations

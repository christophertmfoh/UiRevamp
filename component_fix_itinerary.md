   - Ensure proper state management

3. **Server Routes** - Ensure proper ID generation
   - Add ID generation for POST requests
   - Fix update route data cleaning
   - Verify validation schemas

4. **Database Schema** - Ensure proper insert schemas
   - Remove id from required fields in insert schemas
   - Verify all field mappings match database

### Next Priority: Items

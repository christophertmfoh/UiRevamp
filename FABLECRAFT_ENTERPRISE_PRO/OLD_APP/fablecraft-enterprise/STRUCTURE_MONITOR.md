# 🏗️ Enterprise Directory Structure Monitor

## Overview

This project includes an automated monitoring system that alerts when the codebase has grown enough to benefit from additional directory organization.

## Current Thresholds

Based on senior developer assessment of enterprise standards:

### 📊 File Count Thresholds
- **50-75 files**: Consider adding `types/`, `constants/`, `providers/` directories
- **75+ files**: Critical - time for monorepo package extraction

### 🔍 Pattern-Based Thresholds
- **5+ exported interfaces**: Create `src/types/` directory
- **3+ exported constants**: Create `src/constants/` directory  
- **2+ context providers**: Create `src/providers/` directory

## Usage

### Manual Check
```bash
npm run structure:check
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
npm run structure:watch
```

### VS Code Integration
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type "Tasks: Run Task"
- Select "🏗️ Check Directory Structure"

## Current Status

As of Phase 1-2 completion:
- ✅ **30 files** - optimal for current structure
- ✅ **Co-located types** - enterprise best practice
- ✅ **Clean organization** - ready for scaling

## Why This Matters

### Premature Organization = Technical Debt
- Adding directories too early creates unnecessary complexity
- Co-location is better for small codebases
- Enterprise standards scale with project size

### Optimal Timing
- Monitor growth patterns automatically
- Get alerted at the right thresholds
- Make informed decisions about restructuring

## Future Reorganization Plan

When thresholds are hit, the system will guide you through:

1. **Types Directory** (`src/types/`)
   - Shared interfaces
   - Common type definitions
   - API response types

2. **Constants Directory** (`src/constants/`)
   - App-wide constants
   - Configuration values
   - Enum definitions

3. **Providers Directory** (`src/providers/`)
   - React context providers
   - Global state providers
   - Service providers

## Automation Features
